# demo-blueshield-ocr
This project contains the configurations to provide infrasctructure, on OpenShift, that supports ML and AI workloads for a blueshield demo.  Demo involves gathering unstructured pdfs and using labelstudio (with tesseract) to structure data from the pdfs into structured data.  Structured data will be stored in a vector DB (postgres).
